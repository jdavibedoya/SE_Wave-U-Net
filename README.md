# Speech Enhancement using the Wave-U-Net with Spectral Losses
Adaptation of the [Wave-U-Net](https://github.com/f90/Wave-U-Net) architecture for the speech enhancement task in terms of denoising, dereverberation, decoloration, and bandwidth extension. The network structure is shown below.

## Listening Examples

## Experiments 
The experiments contemplate variations inspired by some of the deep learning networks for speech Enhancement (Spectral Losses, Noise Input Vector, Attention Mechanism, SEGAN+ Variations)
